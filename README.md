# Emergency
## Backend Installation

Prerequisites:

Java: Spring Boot is Java-based, so you need to ensure Java is installed. Typically, Spring Boot recommends using Java 8, 11, or later versions.
Maven or Gradle: This depends on the build tool your project uses. Maven and Gradle are the two most commonly used.
Installation Steps

a. Installing Java:

Download and install the Java JDK. It can be obtained from the Oracle official website or other Java distribution sites.
Configure the environment variables. Ensure that JAVA_HOME is set and that the bin directory is added to the PATH.
b. Installing Maven (if the project uses Maven):

Download the appropriate version of Maven from the official Maven website.
Unzip and configure the environment variables. Ensure that MAVEN_HOME or M2_HOME is set, and the bin directory is added to the PATH.
Using Maven:

bash:
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Accessing the Application

Once the application starts successfully, you can access it in your browser at the default address http://localhost:8080, unless you've changed the default port in the configurations.
